            <em>What sensors are we provided with? What do they do?</em><br /><br />
            <p class="tab">According to this site, Android provides 3 categories of sensors: motion, environmental, and location.<br /><br />
            There are physical sensors and software sensors. According to the site, "The Android sensor framework lets you access many types of sensors. Some of these sensors are hardware-based and some are software-based. Hardware-based sensors are physical components built into a handset or tablet device. They derive their data by directly measuring specific environmental properties, such as acceleration, geomagnetic field strength, or angular change. Software-based sensors are not physical devices, although they mimic hardware-based sensors. Software-based sensors derive their data from one or more of the hardware-based sensors and are sometimes called virtual sensors or synthetic sensors. The linear acceleration sensor and the gravity sensor are examples of software-based sensors."<br /><br />
            Here is a table of types of sensors that is copied from this website with minor modifications:</p><br />

            <li>
                        Accelerometer
            <p>"An accelerometer detects acceleration, vibration, and tilt to determine movement and exact orientation along the three axes. Apps use this smartphone sensor to determine whether your phone is in portrait or landscape orientation. <br />
                It can also tell if your phone screen is facing upward or downward. The accelerometer can also detect how fast your phone is moving in any linear direction."
            </p>
        </li>
            <li>
                Gyroscope
                <p>"Gyroscope also provides orientation details and direction like up/down and left/right but with greater precision like how much the device is tilted. This is where it differs from accelerometer — gyroscope can measure rotation too but the former cannot."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Magnetometer
                <p>"Our smartphones are equipped with magnetometer which we commonly recognize as a compass. It can detect magnetic fields, so the compass app in phones uses this smartphone sensor to point at the planet’s north pole."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                GPS
                <p>"Global Positioning System (GPS) units in smartphone communicate with the satellites to determine our precise location on Earth. The GPS technology doesn’t actually use internet data this is why we can find our location on maps even after losing the signals, but the map itself is blurry as it requires internet to load the details — this is how offline map works. GPS is used in all location-based apps like Uber and Google Maps."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Proximity Sensor
                <p>"A proximity sensor makes use of an infrared LED and IR light detector to find out how close the phone is to an outside object. It used while making calls and when the phone is held to the face to make or receive a call, the sensor detects it and disables the touchscreen display to avoid unintended input through the skin."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Ambient Light Sensor
                <p>"The light sensor detects the lighting levels in the vicinity to adjust the display brightness accordingly. It is used in Automatic Brightness Adjuster to decrease or increase the brightness of the smartphone screen based on the availability of light."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Microphone
                <p>"The microphone is basically a sound sensor that detects and measures the loudness of sound. While there are different types of microphone sensors available, smartphones generally use micro-sized electret microphones."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Touchscreen Sensors
                <p>"The smartphone sensors in a touchscreen have an electrical current passing through them at all times and touching the screen causes a change in the signals. This change acts as input for the device. Before Apple introduced the capacitive touchscreen, resistive screens were used in the display. But nowadays, the capacitive screen is used in almost all smartphones."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Fingerprint Sensor
                <p>"Gone are the days of memorizing passwords and patterns to unlock your phone as many users prefer using the fingerprint scanner these days. Fingerprint sensor enables biometric verification to secure many smartphones today. It is a capacitive scanner that records your fingerprint electrically."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pedometer
                <p>"The pedometer is used for counting steps, and fitness tracker makes use of this sensor to count the number of steps you take. Pedometers generally use the values generated by the accelerometer to monitor your movements like running or walking."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Barcode/QR Code sensors
                <p>"Most of the smartphones have barcode sensors that can read a barcode by detecting the reflected light from the code. It generates an analog signal with varying voltage that represents the barcode. This analog signal is then converted to a digital one and finally decoded to reveal the information in it. Barcode sensors are useful in scanning the barcodes products or QR codes."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Barometer
                <p>"There are many high-end Android phones like Pixel and iPhones that include a barometer in their hardware. The barometer measures the air pressure, so it is quite useful in detecting weather changes and in calculating the altitude you’re at."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Heart Rate Sensor
                <p>"Next up is the heart rate sensor that measures heartbeat with the help of LED and optical sensors. The LED emits light towards the skin, and this smartphone sensor looks for the light waves reflected by it."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Thermometer
                <p>
                    "Every smartphone comes with an inbuilt thermometer for monitoring the temperature inside the device and battery. In case a component starts overheating, the system shuts down itself to prevent any damage.<br />
                    However, some handsets come with additional thermometers to measure ambient temperature. If you can recall, the Samsung Galaxy S4 bragged of thermometer that can measure temperature. Such thermometer sensors can be used by apps to detect your room temperature."

            </li>
            <li>
                Air Humidity Sensor
                <p>"Now that we are talking about Galaxy S4 let’s discuss the Air Humidity sensor as well. S4 was the first smartphone to incorporate an air humidity sensor. It could measure the humidity in the air, and the data collected by it would tell the user whether the given air temperature and humidity are optimum or not. But again, this type of sensor is used by selected handsets only."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Geiger Counter
                <p>"Now, this is one smartphone sensor that you should not expect to find in common devices. In fact, there is only one phone that supports it – the Sharp Pantone 5. This handset has been released in Japan only. The Geiger Counter in it can measure the current radiation level in the area."</p>
